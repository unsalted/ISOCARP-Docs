# # = header 1 (biggest header size)
## ## = header 2 (medium header size)
### ### = header 3 (smallest header size)

```
NOTE: Header styles are applied to all words which follow until the next line break. To end a header style insert a line break.
```

*\*…\* = italic text*

**\*\*…\*\* = bold text**

(link: URL text: ...) = link

(mail: mail address text: ...) > mail

```
NOTE: Whatever you write behind "text:" appears in your text as link.
