```
INFO: You can stylise every piece of text (header, bold, italic, link, email) in order to highlight parts or create links. The text style is not immediately visible in the panel though and follows different rules than in usual text editors.
```

- on top of every text box you see buttons for the different style options (h1, h2, h3, bold, italic, link and email) **(1)**
- **“h”** stands for header
- you can either mark the text you want to change and hit a style option (visual follows…)
- or you click a style button first, then you will see a place holder text within symbols (*/#, for example: \*\*bold text\*\*)
- simply replace the placeholder text with the text which needs to be styled, without deleting the symbols
- you can also type out the indications for stylised text by hand:

# # = header 1 (biggest header size)
## ## = header 2 (medium header size)
### ### = header 3 (smallest header size)

```
NOTE: Header styles are applied to all words which follow until the next line break. To end a header style insert a line break.
```

*\*…\* = italic text*

**\*\*…\*\* = bold text**

(link: *URL* text: ...) = link

(mail: *mail address* text: ...) > mail

```
NOTE: Whatever you write behind "text:" appears in your text as link.
``` 

**TIP: Your text won’t appear stylised in the panel. If you want to preview the changes you have made, press the small magnifying glass symbol on the top right of the page you are on.**

```

- therefor he downloads and sends out so called *.csv files*
- go to **“Who will be there?”** in the directory (Home>Theme>Theme Name>Who will be there?) **(1)**
- open the **“File”** section **(2)**
- click **“Upload a new file”** on the right top of the page
- upload the latest *.csv file* which was downloaded from **MailChimp** and send to you by a main administrator
- the **“Who will be there?”** page is now updated
- No further styling has to be done
